# Malicious URL Detection Bot ü§ñüõ°Ô∏è  

Welcome to the Malicious URL Detection Bot, a cutting-edge WhatsApp-based chatbot created as part of the GDSC Hackin Winters 2025 Hackathon. This project introduces a robust, user-friendly system for identifying and mitigating threats posed by malicious URLs. It combines the power of APIs, Python, and browser extension technologies to protect users from phishing and fraudulent websites.
The browser extension complements the WhatsApp bot by providing an additional layer of security during web browsing. It automatically monitors  malicious URLs using a predefined, developer-provided list.

## üí° **About the Project**  

The **Malicious URL Detection Bot**  Users send a URL to the bot via WhatsApp.
The bot processes the URL and determines its safety using:Threat intelligence APIs (e.g., VirusTotal, PhishTank).Custom algorithms that analyze patterns in the URL.Replies instantly with a detailed report on the URL's status.
**Browser Extension for URL Safety** The browser extension complements and enhances the usability of the WhatsApp-based Malicious URL Detection Bot by extending its functionality across multiple platforms, such as web browsers, emails, and other online services. It acts as a proactive layer of defense, providing real-time URL safety checks as users navigate the internet, ensuring comprehensive protection beyond WhatsApp.
